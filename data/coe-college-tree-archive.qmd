By creating an online archive, the project attempts to collect valuable environmental data and promote engagement with Coe’s urban forest. The online archive features interactive maps, profiles of Coe’s trees, environmental benefit estimates, tips for tree identification, and opportunities to contribute to the archive."

I started the project in the Fall semester of my senior year at Coe, and thanks to support from the faculty and students at Coe, I continue to gratefully maintain the tree archive. Apart from this website, the Coe College Tree Archive is also accessible through [Stewart Memorial Library's databases](https://coe.libguides.com/az.php), [Coe College's sustainability page](https://www.coe.edu/why-coe/discover-coe/environmental-sustainability-coe-green), and of course your favorite search engine. All data and code for the project are available on the [archive's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CoeTreeArchive/CoeTreeArchive.github.io).
