Apart from this website, the Coe College Tree Archive is also accessible through Stewart Memorial Library’s databases and Coe College’s sustainability page. All data and code for the project are available on the archive’s GitHub repository."

    "text": "About the Data\nThis project archives daily forecast data from the National Weather Service. All data come from the National Weather Service’s API. The API’s site contains relevant information and documentation about data available in the repository. To collect forecast data from the National Weather Service’s API, a user must first use the API to find an endpoint URL for a specific (user provided) latitude and longitude. This latitude and longitude is then mapped to the forecasting grid that the National Weather Service uses, and the API returns a URL of the gridpoint associated with the provided latitude and longitude. Then this endpoint URL can be passed back to the API, which returns forecast data.\nUsing the API requires us to choose GPS coordinates that we want forecast data from. To keep this most relevant to policy researchers, I choose to use the GPS coordinates of all US county centroids as well as the GPS coordinates of all US power plants. The forecast data returned is at a subdaily frequency—one observation for the daytime and one observation for the nighttime. I restrict the data to just day-of forecasts, omitting forecasts made, for instance, three days ahead.\nThere are many incredible resources for weather and climate data in the US. Notably, the National Center for Environmental Information provides county-level climate data. Unfortunately these data do not contain potentially relevant fields to policy researchers (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover)."

Santos and Kristian Blickle and work on research projects that aim to improve our understanding of how evolving climate risks impact household finance and financial intermediation.\nMy research interests are centered around the equity implications of energy, environmental, and climate policy—particularly those implications related to disparities in air quality. To study these topics, I’m primarily interested in using models from industrial organization alongside physical models of environmental systems.\nI hold a BA in Economics and Math from Coe College, a liberal arts college located in my home state of Iowa. I also take graduate classes as a non-degree seeking student in math and statistics at NYU. When I’m not working, I enjoy drawing and bird watching (though I’m not particularly good at either).\nAll views expressed on this website are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve System, or its Board of Governors."
